 <h2>
  Ferdinand Marcos took power as President of the Philippines on December 30th, 1965 as the head of a brutal dictatorship that would last until the People Power Revolution of 1986. Throughout the Marcos regime, the Filipino people faced extreme repression at a social and economic level with nearly 7 out of 10 families below the poverty line and tens of thousands jailed, tortured, and killed without trial during the 14 year period of Martial Law which had been established in 1972. While the Filipino masses were suffering in the cities and countryside, Marcos and his family delighted in extravagant parties, vacations, and personal construction projects, paid for by the billions plundered from public funds. At the fall of the regime in 1986, the United States rescued Marcos and his family, offering them safe passage to the US where he lived out the rest of his life without repercussion. 
  
  Alongside a vast portfolio of billions of dollars in art and commercial assets, these 13 real estate properties scattered throughout the northeast serve as a monument to the rampant embezzlement of the Marocs regime and all the lives lost in favor of profit.
