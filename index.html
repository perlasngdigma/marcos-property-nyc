 <h2>
  Ferdinand Marcos, as President of the Philippines, established what would go onto be . His regime was characterized by widespread corruption, human rights abuses, and authoritarian rule. In 1972, Marcos declared martial law, claiming it was necessary to suppress communist insurgency and restore law and order. However, it effectively allowed him to consolidate power, dissolve Congress, and suppress political opposition.
  
  During the martial law period, Marcos and his wife, Imelda Marcos, amassed immense wealth through corruption and cronyism. They used their positions to acquire properties both in the Philippines and abroad, including several luxurious properties in New York City. These properties became symbols of the Marcos regime's excesses and abuses of power.</h2>
